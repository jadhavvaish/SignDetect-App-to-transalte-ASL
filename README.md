# SignDetect-App-to-translate-ASL
**Overview**
The Sign Detect Translation App is designed to recognize and translate hand gestures into American Sign Language (ASL) to facilitate communication between individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing and those who are not fluent in sign language. Leveraging computer vision and machine learning techniques, the app detects hand gestures captured by a camera and provides real-time translations into ASL.

**Features**
-Real-time hand gesture recognition using computer vision algorithms.
 This app helps to translate American Sign Language(ASL) into English. Output is produced in 2 forms - Text and Voice.
-Translation of detected gestures into ASL signs.
-User-friendly interface for easy interaction.

**Technologies Used**
-Python for backend development and machine learning models.
-Mediapipe and OpenCV for computer vision and image processing.
-TensorFlow or PyTorch for deep learning-based gesture recognition.
-Mobile development framework 'Flutter' for cross-platform mobile app development.
